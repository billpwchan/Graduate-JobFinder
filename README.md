## Highlights

- **Graduate Job Vacancies Scrapping Tools**: Graduate Job Finder is an easy to use web scrapping tool to help graduates quickly find vacancies in their dream companies. The list will continue to grow as I write more scripts in the future. 
- **WHY NOT LINKEDIN or OTHER PROFESSIONAL PLATFORMS?**: This is because for those Top-Tier companies, their vacancies aren't directly published on traditional job seeking platforms such as LinkedIn. Most of the time students have to go directly to their career page for searching. This repository helps you automatically scrap vacancies from those famous companies so to save you some time.

## Future Plans
